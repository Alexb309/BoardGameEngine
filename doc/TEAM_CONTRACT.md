## As a project team, we promise to:

### Respect Each Other

We will be receptive to everyone's ideas and work for this project.

### Communicate Early and Often

All members will keep each other in the loop about their portions of the project. If issues arise,
they will be communicated with the rest of the team ASAP. This includes having meetings several
times each week.

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:

* Have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* Report the issue in the Team Sprint Report

## Team Procedures

### Team meetings

* Full team meetings will happen at least once per week
    * Sub-team meetings will happen more often, at least twice per week in addition to the full team
      meetings
* How to communicate action items made during the meeting
    * Action items will be tracked on Trello, progress updates and blockers will be tracked in
      Slack.
* Policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to
  make up for it
    * If a team member has to miss a meeting, they should let team members know the day before
    * Meeting notes will be posted to slack, and missing members should keep track of these notes to
      know their responsibilities
* Policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting
    * All members are open to discuss any design AIChoices or the meeting structure
    * Disagreements must be resolved in 15 minutes to allow for other topics in meetings

### Communications

* Decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
    * Decisions will be made by consensus, but if they cannot be resolved this way, they will
      default to a majority vote (9 members, meaning ties won't happen).
* Preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
    * Slack will be used for messages and keeping track of resources and meeting notes
    * Zoom meetings will be used when members cannot meet in person
* Response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)
    * Members should respond to outstanding questions ASAP. Members should check Slack atleast once
      a day to stay in the loop and see if anyone has questions.
* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates
    * Members will use slack for updates on major decisions that are made outside of team meetings

### Helping each other

* how and when to ask for help and what is needed to show effort
    * Members should ask for help whenever they need to. If a member feels uncomfortable asking for
      help then they should let the Professor know.
    * Members can ask for help in Zoom meetings, Slack messages, or in person meetings.
* response to team member asking for help
    * Members should respond to team members asking for help ASAP.
    * Members should be respectful when helping someone.
* ways to "go above and beyond" as needed to support the team and even other teams
    * Members should monitor the entire progress of the project, not just the parts that they are
      responsible for.
    * This includes reviewing and commenting on merge requests

### Commitments

* what does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"
    * To work to the "best of your ability", members should make constant progress on the parts of
      the project that they are responsible for.
    * Members should communicate issues directly with the rest of the team
* how to set internal deadlines
    * Team-wide deadlines will be set during weekly meetings
    * Sub-teams may set internal deadlines outside the larger project if needed
* how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
    * Members should only make commitments if they are confident that they can be met.
    * It is better to be modest than to over-promise and under-deliver
* policy for resolving failure to meet commitments
    * If the team feels as though certain members aren't meeting commitments, they should
      communicate directly with that team member. If this issue persists, the team should take
      further actions by letting the Professor know.
